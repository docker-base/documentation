:::info
All added systems need some maintenance and therefore we focus on keeping things stable rather than supporting everything.
Maybe we'll add a feature to load additional systems in the future.

Nginx webserver is used and some plugins maybe need some additional config. 

`.htaccess` is not supported in nginx webserver.
:::

## Custom

Has a basic nginx rewrite and supports applications like Symfony.
The nginx config can be overwritten in every project. Has no install script or load. 
Like nginx config a custom load hook can be added to every project.

## Grav

Grav is a special case because it is a file base CMS and needs no database.
That means you can load hello world container instead of `phpmyadmin-alpin` and `mariadb`.

## Wordpress

Runs a Wordpress. 
Tested with [Bedrock](https://github.com/roots/bedrock) and vanilla Wordpress.

### Special
- Adds `wp-cli`
- Always installs a [Bedrock](https://github.com/roots/bedrock) based system if you choose to init a fresh Wordpress project.

## Shopware 5

:::warning End of life (ELO)
Shopware 5 has more or less a EOL date and Shopware recommends to use Shopware 6 for new projects
:::

Shopware 5 needs a lot of rules and allows to start a new project.
(Shopware 6 should work with custom because is heavily build on Symfony. Only the installer could fail.)
