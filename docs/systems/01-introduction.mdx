Docker Mate supports some systems with load and install hocks, but you can run nearly everything in custom and store your configuration in your project repository.

## Supported systems

All added systems need some maintenance and therefore we focus on keeping things stable rather than supporting everything.

## Webserver config

Docker Mate uses nginx as webserver and that means no `.htaccess` is supported. Systems will include a site.conf for nginx. Some systems have no nginx config included or documented, and we use the recommended setting from the community.

:::warning nginx configuration
`.htaccess` is not supported in nginx webserver.
