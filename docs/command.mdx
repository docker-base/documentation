### `ssh-app`

## Certificates

### `cert-install`

:::caution Certificate issues
- Certificate is not installed everywhere in your system and commands like `curl` or `wget` may fail.
- CAA can cause issues with normal domains. This pins the Certificate Authority for a domain. `*.docker` should never be a problem.
