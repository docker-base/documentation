## Installation

:::success Up to date system
As docker mate is a local environment and no LTS server, often the latest Version of Docker & Docker Compose is used and tested.
:::

### Linux

Depending on your distro you need docker, docker-compose, zsh, envsubstr, make, mkcert and depending on system maybe some other packages like composer or yarn/npm. Local composer uses cache, has maybe a token for higher limits and other advantages.

Depending on your package manager and package sources will affect your installation

#### Arch linux

```shell script
pacman -S docker docker-compose
pacman -S mkcert # Generates certs and installs a local root cert
pacman -S dnsmasq # You can also use a different tool
```

:::info NetworkManager
If you use the NetworkManager and DHCP you need to choose `Address only` and add the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
:::

#### Other Distros

You can find multiple ways to install [mkcert on GitHub](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert)

### macOS

macOS needs `mkcert` and `envsubst`.
All other required utilities should be installed out of box under macOS. For some systems php and composer is required.

#### Homebrew installation

Homebrew is a package manager that supports updates and provides easy installation to a lot of open source software.

```shell script
brew install mkcert gettext
# envsubst is part of gettext
brew link --force gettext

# (optional) install composer via brew
brew install composer
```

### Windows (unsupported)

Untested & unsupported - maybe Docker Mate works within the linux subsystem (WSL).

## Prerequisites

You need a DNS resolve utility like dnsmasq to resolve `.docker` domains locally to your host.
```text title="dnsmasq.conf"
address=/.docker/127.0.0.1
address=/.docker/::1
```

:::caution
If you manipulate used domains for local development, you should consider adding some kind of browser addon that shows the current IP for the domain to avoid connections to wrong web/server.
Browsers also use internal DNS-Caches: force reload often helps in these cases e.g. `Ctrl (+ Shift) + F5`.
:::

## Usage

Clone docker mate into a new folder

<Tabs
  groupId="git-remote"
  defaultValue="ssh"
  values={[
    {label: 'SSH', value: 'ssh'},
    {label: 'HTTPS', value: 'https'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="ssh">

  ```shell script
  git clone git@github.com:docker-mate/docker-mate.git your-project
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="https">

  ```shell script
  git clone https://github.com/docker-mate/docker-mate.git your-project
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Install system

:::note
For existing projects you can use the `make load` command
:::

It will create all necessary configs for your project and install it in some cases. Will also work with `make` as fallback.
```shell
make init
```

1. Choose a system for your project (all available systems in the `.systems/` directory)
2. Wait until it is finished. Depending on system additional imports maybe required.

### Automation (avoid input)

Some variables exist to run tests and can also be used to create a project and *avoid* the input during installation

```dotenv
# Folder name from systems
NEW_PROJECT_TYPE=system

# Chosse a *domain*.docker
NEW_PROJECT_NAME=domain

# y\n - yes or not to git init in app ([y]es requries inut during the installation)
NEW_PROJECT_GIT=n
```
#### Example
```shell
NEW_PROJECT_TYPE=system NEW_PROJECT_NAME=domain NEW_PROJECT_GIT=n make init
```
